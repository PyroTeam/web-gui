# Common Javascript libs
Because of the competition context, the web-gui should work offline.  
So external libs are saved here, in full and minified version.  
Current versions should be avoided to ensure application reliability. A lib update can be done with care.

## Update lib
Simply download full and minified javascript file for your library in libs/ dir. Please name minified file LIBNAME-version.min.js and uncompressed file LIBNAME-version.js.  
Do not remove the first last version. All others older versions can be removed.
